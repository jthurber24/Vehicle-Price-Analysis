# Vehicle-Price-Analysis
Our main goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately predicts the selling price of a car based on its various attributes. Furthermore, our model could be adapted to current market conditions by extending the time frame, enabling us to conduct a timeline analysis. We plan to use various regression analysis techniques to uncover the underlying relationships between predictors such as year, make, model, condition, odometer reading, etc., and the selling price of vehicles in the dataset. By understanding these relationships, we aimed to answer other key questions as well, such as:
1.	How do various attributes like year, make, condition, odometer reading, etcâ€¦ correlate with the selling price of a car?
2.	Can we identify any influential factors that significantly impact the selling price of vehicles?
3.	Are there any anomalies or outliers in the data that could skew our analysis and predictions?
4.	How well can we model and predict the selling price of cars based on the available attributes?
